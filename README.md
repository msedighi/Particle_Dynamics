Particles Dynamics Simulation

This a simulation engine for particle dynamics. It uses Verlet, Beeman & Runge-Kutta methods to solve Newton's equations for any number of particles with initial positions & velocities (could be chosen as random). Other than internal forces the system is free. The internal force can be chosen by user, the functions for spring force and gravitaion (or any radial force proportional to power of distance) is provided.

Note, The code is not completed. Use is at your own risk!
